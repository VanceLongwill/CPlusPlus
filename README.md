Cell Phone Invoice Calculator Program.cpp

Suppose that you are asked to develop a cell phone invoice calculator program.
There are two types of tariffs for users:
(1) the users that do not use any package are charged
0.15 TL/6 seconds
(2) the 'eco' package users will pay 19 TL fixed fee for first 50 minutes 
and 0.2 TL/6 seconds for extra talking time that exceeds 50 minutes
The program will get the total number of talking time in terms of minutes 
(double type) and then calculate and print the 
total amount that the user will pay for each tariff type.
Write the C++ source code of the above program.

A. Reading and Displaying Data  
The first part of your program will read some player information from a file, 
format the information, put it into an array of structures, and then display that array on the screen.
Use the following formulas for the calculated values (points and shooting %) using a function:  
Number of Points = Number of Goals Scored + Number of Assists  
Shooting Percentage = Number of Goals Scored / Number of Shots Taken * 100
